Thanks a lot for this post.
Although I’m a bit late, but I still hope you can help me:

Everything worked but I would like to be able to automatically use the C/C++ Remote Application configuration. Instead – when I clich on the arrow or press Ctrl+F11 – Eclipse creates a new run C/C++ Application configuration.

Is there a way to change this behavour? I’m using Eclipse 3.8.

Yes it is certainly possible to change the default run configuration though I can’t recall how to do it off the top of my head and I don’t have Eclipse installed at the moment. A google search or some browsing on Stack Overflow should point you in the right direction.

I can see that there are now 2 comments, but I can’t see any of them.
Would you mine emailing me?

Thank you for this article. I am an senior student majoring in electrical engineering. I came across the beaglebone last year for a school project and I loved it. My question is what would be the right path academically to master this stuff? All i know so far is from browsing and learning on my own. I’d love a formal training. Also I was trying to achieve this on mac with xcode, with no success at all. Is there a way to achieve this? Finally, I am also on the process a creating a blog about technology, any advice would be appreciated. Thank you for your effort and take care.

Michael,
This blog is really very helpful, Thank you very much.
I have one query. In last couple of steps where we return to “Run Configuration” which path we exactly select? Can you please elaborate those steps? For me everything worked as expected but only last step is giving an error saying “Permission denied”. So, I am pretty sure that I am making mistake in path selection.
Thanks in advance!

Following step by step I was doing good until after “If you have multiple Toolchain options just choose one”. I did so and then was faced with a dialog box asking for the Cross compiler prefix, and Cross compiler path. So I didn’t reach the “set up some of the template options” in the next paragraph. Do you have any idea what goes in this dialog? I’m using Eclipse V. 3.8.1

Hi,

I have no option to run remotely my app because ‘RUN’ button is not highlighted. I have followed all your steps, and there is no way to remotely run nothing.

Regards.

Hi,

there is no option to run remote C++ application, even when every parameter is properly configured (All steps have been repeated several times, even cleaning the eclipse workspace).

‘RUN’ button is not highlighted.

Could you help me to solve this issue, please?

Hello, I really appreciate this write-up. But I have hit some snags…
1st Debian doesn’t have the package “gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi” I had to go with “gcc-arm-none-eabi” or maybe I messed up…
2nd During the compilation step after switching to the arm tools I get linker errors complaining about missing references to ‘_exit’ and several others. They are all called from newlibs sources… I was hoping you might be able to shed some light or at least get me barking up the right tree. Thanks again for writing this. Cheers

Looks like SSH Terminals has been removed from eclipse as a default option. There was no ‘next’ beyond SSH shells step. I saw another article suggesting that the terminal has been separated as its own plugin or something.

Great tutorial!!
I followed your steps until the end…But when I ran it, I didnt get the “!!!Hello Bleaglebone!!!” message. I got as bellow:

Last login: Sun Mar 1 22:37:56 2015 from cleber-hp-pavilion-14-notebook-pc.local
echo $PWD’>’
+x /home/cleber/TCC;/home/cleber/TCC;/home/cleber/TCC;exit
root@beaglebone:~# echo $PWD’>’
/root>

-bash: +x: command not found
-bash: /home/cleber/TCC: Is a directory
-bash: /home/cleber/TCC: Is a directory
logout

Could you help me to get the expected results on the console?
Tks a lot!

@keil run this command on your beaglebone black in the directory where test is:

$ readelf -l test |grep interpreter
[Requesting program interpreter: /lib/ld-linux.so.3] <—– note down the program interpreter request on your machine output
$ readelf -l /bin/ls |grep interpreter
[Requesting program interpreter: /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3] <—- note down the program interpreter your beaglebone is using

If your beaglebone is using armhf then you need to compile on the host machine with the cross compiler arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++-4.8

I installed it on Ubuntu with : sudo apt-get install g++-arm-linux-gnueabihf

You can then go over the steps in the guide substituting the gnueabihf compiler for the one in the guide i.e. gnueabi

Hi,
Can you use 64bit Linux for the Ubuntu load, or do you need to use the 32bit version?
Thanks,
