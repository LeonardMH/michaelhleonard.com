The first step is to choose what CAD package you will be using in order
to design your PCB. There are a dizzying amount of options on the market
and I don't know that I can even attempt to list them all, but here are
some of your options:

- [EAGLE][1] (Free with limitations, upgrades from $70 - $1640)- A
powerhouse in the hobbyist world, EAGLE probably has the most community
support, but has some quirks that led me to choose a different suite.

- [KiCad][2] (Free and open source, no limitations) - This is my current
personal favorite. As a FOSS option that is quite capable, you have
nothing to lose by trying it out. I think it is better than EAGLE, and
you can't argue with that price.

- [gEDA][3] (Free and open source, no limitations) - Another excellent
FOSS option, gEDA and KiCad are often compared. I tried them both and
felt that KiCad was a bit more polished, but you may want to try gEDA
for yourself.

- [ExpressPCB][4] (Free, no limitations) - It seems like good software,
I have never used it personally but enough people seem to recommend it.
ExpressPCB is backed by, you guessed it, ExpressPCB so this makes it
very easy to send your design for manufacture.

- [DesignSpark PCB][5] (Free, no limitations) - I had never head of
DesignSpark until I started writing this post. I have to say I am very
impressed by what they show on the landing page so I may check it out.

- [DipTrace][6] (Non-free, prices from $70 - $900) - DipTrace comes
highly recommended, I prefer free and open-source software (FOSS) so I
have never used it, but it may be worth your time.

- [PCB123][7] (Free, more powerful packages non-free) - This software
from Sunstone looks very promising, I'm sure there are some hidden
limitations that I couldn't find, but I will be checking out this
package when I start my next design.

- [EasyPC][8] (Non-free, $500-$2700) - I haven't used this software
personally but it looks well designed (kind of reminds me of Altium
Designer), the price is high for hobbyist use but wouldn't be too bad
for a professional.

- [Mentor Graphics PADS][9] (Non-free, cost unknown, likely &gt;$5000) -
This software seems to have fairly poor user feedback, I don't know why
you would choose to voluntarily use it. From what I can tell, most of
its current user base is from engineers in a corporate setting that are
required to use it for backward compatibility.

- [Altium Designer][10] (Non-free, &gt;$5000) - Altium Designer has
excellent user feedback, if you are looking for a professional suite to
work with and can handle the price tag, Altium may be your best option.

- [OrCad PCB Designer][11] (Non-free, &gt;$5000, upgrade path can push
you north of $25000) - Cadence OrCad is a behemoth in the EDA industry,
unfortunately they also throw that weight around by charging insane
prices. If you absolutely need the features offered by OrCad then it may
be worth your investment, but for the average user this is overkill.

So I wasn't lying, it's a big list! When we narrow it down and look at
what's practical though, I think the first three options are the most
interesting for hobbyists.

As I said in the summary, EAGLE is a very popular package and has a huge
community of hobbyists that use it for their projects. Unfortunately
there are some nagging issues with EAGLE that have caused me to abandon
it in search of greener pastures

For various reasons, I ultimately decided on KiCad, but since this isn't a comparison article I won't go into details. If you are curious about my reasoning, <a href="http://www.bigmessowires.com/2010/05/03/eagle-vs-kicad/">this article </a>does a good job of highlighting what I didn't like about EAGLE, though I don't fully agree with his assessment of KiCad.
